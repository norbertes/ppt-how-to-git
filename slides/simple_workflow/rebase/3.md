###### git rerere
- Stands for: reuse recorded resolution

      git config --global rerere.enabled true
    <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
##### long time branch
- You can merge main branch often, resolve conflicts and abort merge
- When you'll finish working on your feature, final rebase will be extremely easy - rerere will remember your choices
- (or just rebase often)
